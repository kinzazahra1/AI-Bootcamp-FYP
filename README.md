Question Answering System with Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2

# Project Overview
This project implements a question-answering system using the Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 model. The system is designed to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses to user queries by leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The project integrates this model into a web application, providing a user-friendly interface via Gradio for input and output, while FastAPI manages backend processes, facilitating efficient communication between the user interface and the model.

# Features
Interactive Q&A: Users can interact with the Mistral-7B model by asking questions and receiving precise answers.
Gradio Interface: A simple and intuitive web-based interface that allows users to input questions and view answers in real-time.
FastAPI Backend: A fast and efficient backend server that handles requests from the Gradio interface and communicates with the Mistral-7B model to generate responses.
Deployed on Hugging Face: The model is also deployed on Hugging Face Spaces for easy access and interaction.

# Technology Stack
Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 Model: A powerful language model used for generating contextually relevant answers to questions.

Gradio: A Python library that provides an easy-to-use web interface, allowing users to interact with the model directly from their browser.

FastAPI: A modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python, which serves as the backend of the application to handle requests and manage the interaction between the Gradio interface and the Mistral-7B model.

ngrok: Used for creating secure tunnels to localhost, making the FastAPI server accessible over the internet.
