        "## This project implements a question-answering system using the Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 model, which provides accurate and contextually relevant responses to user queries. The model has been integrated into a web application with Gradio serving as the frontend and FastAPI managing the backend processes. Users can input their questions through the Gradio interface, which communicates with the FastAPI server to retrieve answers generated by the Mistral-7B model. This setup demonstrates how advanced language models can be utilized in practical applications for real-time interaction and information retrieval."
